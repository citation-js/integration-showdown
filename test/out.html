<p>All research extends or uses knowledge from other research. With the primary goal of scholarly publishing being the distribution of knowledge, it is important that the publications --- and the literature they cite --- are distributed in an accessible, identifiable and findable manner (Shotton, 2013). That also allows the analysis and visualisation of how research cites each other (Shotton, 2013; van Eck &#38; Waltman, 2014). While traditionally journals required text-based citations, each formatted in their own specific style, the last few decades the use of Persistent IDentifiers (PIDs) has become commonplace, with Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) being the most common for scholarly articles, and International Standard Book Numbers (ISBNs) for books. These PIDs are then linked to central stores that provide machine-readable bibliographic information, such as Crossref and DataCite (Brase, 2009; Lammey, 2015; Neumann &#38; Brase, 2014).</p>
